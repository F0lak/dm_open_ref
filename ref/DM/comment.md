## comment


Comments may be used to explain code. They can also be used to
turn off a line or block of code. All text inside a comment is ignored
by the compiler. 

The single line comment begins with `//` and
runs to the end of the line. 

The multi-line comment begins with
`/*` and runs until `*/`. 

Multi-line comments may be nested.
### Example:

```
 // single line comment /\* multi-line comment \*/ 
```
