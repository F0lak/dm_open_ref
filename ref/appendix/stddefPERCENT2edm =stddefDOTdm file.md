## stddef.dm file


This is a special file that\'s included in all projects when
you compile. It contains various constants, definitions of some built-in
datums, and so on. 

You can see the contents of this file by
creating a new file in Dream Maker called `stddef.dm`. It will
automatically be filled with the standard definitions. 

The
contents of `stddef.dm` may change with new BYOND versions. However an
eye is always kept on backwards-compatibility.
