**Format:**    
:   A &= B    
Set A equal to A & B. It is shorthand for A = A & B.    
This is commonly used to turn off certain bitfields in a word.    
### Example:    
usr.sight &= \~BLIND // turn off the blind bit    
If A and B are lists, items in A that are not in B are removed.    
If A is an /icon or /matrix datum, the datum will be changed rather than    
creating a new one and re-assigning it to A.
