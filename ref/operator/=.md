**Format:**    
:   A = B    
Set A equal to B.    
Note that this is not the same as the equality test (==), which tests if    
A is equal to B.    
All assignment operators, including calculate-and-assign (such as the +=    
operator), can be chained together, and they are evaluated in    
right-to-left order. Therefore, a = b += c is a legal statement. It is    
equivalent to adding b and c, storing the result in b, then setting a to    
use the new value of b. (a = b) += c will, on the other hand, set a to    
equal b, then add c to a and store the result in a; b is never changed.
