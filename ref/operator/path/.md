## / path operator
**See also:**
+   [. path operator](/ref/operator/path/%2e.md) 
+   [+ path operator](/ref/operator/path/:.md) 

This is used to delimit paths in the DM code tree. A path
beginning with \'/\' is an absolute path (which is independent of where
in the code it is used). Otherwise, a path is relative, meaning it
starts from the current position in the code. 

The following
example uses a path in the code tree to define the type of object to
create when leaving a corpse behind.
### Example:

```
 obj var poison nutrition corpse frog nutrition = 10 spider
nutrition = 6 poison = 5 mob var corpse = /obj/corpse Die() new
corpse(src.loc) //create the corpse here del src spider corpse =
/obj/corpse/spider frog corpse = /obj/corpse/frog 
```
