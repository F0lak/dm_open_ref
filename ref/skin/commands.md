## client commands


Several commands can be executed on the client that are not
verbs, but instructions for Dream Seeker. Some of these commands have
detailed syntax described in their own reference entries.
[.winset](/ref/skin/.winset.md) 
+   Sets skin parameters, and includes special syntax for conditional
    actions.
[.output](/ref/skin/.output.md) 
+   Sends output to a control.
.options
+   Shows the Options & Messages box.
.reboot
+   Reboots the world, when Dream Seeker is also acting as a server.
.reconnect
+   Reconnects to the same world.
.host
+   Opens hosting options box, when Dream Seeker is also acting as a
    server.
.profile
+   Opens the profiler. On a remote connection you may not have access
    to profile server procs, but you can look at the client and network
    profilers.
.screenshot
+   Saves a screenshot of the map. If there\'s more than one map
    control, the default map is used.
.screenshot auto
+   Saves a screenshot of the map, but does not prompt for a filename.
    The file will be saved in the client\'s user directory in
    BYOND/screenshots.
.gamepad-mapping
+   Opens the gamepad mapping dialog. Helpful if the user\'s gamepad is
    not supported or not configured to their liking.
.command
+   Prompts the user to enter a command, which can be one of these
    commands as well.
[.sound](/ref/skin/.sound.md) 
+   Play, stop, or update sound.
.configure *option* *value*
+   Toggle certain Dream Seeker config options, such as
    `.configure graphics-hwmode on`. The only supported options you can
    use are `graphics-hwmode`, `sound`, and `delay` which is an old
    mechanism for dynamically adapting to network delay. (Usually the
    `delay` is reset to 0.)
.quit
+   Closes Dream Seeker.
### Embedded Winget


Commands that are initiated by the skin (like button.command,
map.on-show, etc.) have a special syntax that allows you to include
information that would normally require a winget call. By including
`[[`*`something`*`]]` in the command, the double-bracketed text will be
replaced by the result of running a winget on that parameter. 

A
value of `[[id.parameter]]` will run a winget on the control with the
given ID. Just using `[[parameter]]` will run a winget for the control
that initiated this command. You can also use `parent` in place of the
ID to do something with the parent of the control, or `parent.id` for
access to a sibling control. Position and size parameters can be further
broken down by appending `.x` or `.y` to get at the numbers directly.


Several commands already support some special cases like
`[[*]]` or `[[width]]` or such, where the special-case values are
relevant to the command. An example is that in `on-size` the value of
`[[*]]` is a size value. The Any macro, gamepad macros, and mouse
macros, also support this syntax; see [macros](/ref/skin/macros.md)  for
more info. 

You can choose how embedded wingets get formatted by
following the value with `as` and a type, such as
`[[window.size as string]]`. There are several types you can use, and
different types of parameters get formatted differently:
arg
+   Value is formatted as if it\'s an argument on a command line.
    Numbers are left alone; booleans are 0 or 1; size and position have
    their X and Y values separated by a space; pretty much everything
    else is DM-escaped and enclosed in quotes.
escaped
+   DM-escape the value as if it\'s in a quoted string but do not
    include the quotes. Size and position values both use `,` to
    separate their X and Y values.
string
+   Value is formatted as a DM-escaped string with surrounding quotes.
params
+   Format value for a URL-encoded parameter list (see
    [list2params](/ref/proc/list2params.md)), escaping characters as
    needed.
json
+   JSON formatting. Numbers are left unchanged; size or position values
    are turned into objects with x and y items; boolean values are
    `true` or `false`.
json-dm
+   JSON formatting, but DM-escaped so it can be included in a quoted
    string. Quotes are not included.
raw
+   Does not change the value\'s text representation in any way; assumes
    it\'s already formatted correctly for the purpose. This is similar
    to `as arg` but does no escaping and no quotes.


The `arg` type is the default, unless the `[[`*...*`]]`
expression has double quotes on both sides, in which case `escaped` is
the default.
