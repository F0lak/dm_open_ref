## world
**See also:**
*   [procs (world)](/world/proc)
*   [vars (world)](/world/var)


The world node is used to define some global properties for the
world. Like the other types, the world has overridable vars and procs.
New vars and procs cannot be defined under world though; to make global
vars and procs, use /var and /proc instead.
